## Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.

    a.Start
    b.Input num
    c.num % 400 = 0 or num % 100 != 0 && num % 4 = 0
        print 'Leap year' exit
    d.print 'Not a leap year' exit
    e.stop


2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.
